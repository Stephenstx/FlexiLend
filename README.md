# FlexiLend üöÄ

A flexible multi-asset peer-to-peer lending platform built on Stacks blockchain, enabling users to create custom loan terms with support for STX, SIP-10 tokens, and NFTs as collateral. **Now featuring dynamic interest rates based on real-time supply/demand and risk assessment!**

## üéØ Overview

FlexiLend revolutionizes decentralized lending by allowing borrowers to set their own terms while ensuring lenders are protected through multi-asset collateral requirements. The platform uses smart contracts to automate loan creation, funding, repayment, and liquidation processes across multiple asset types. Our new **dynamic interest rate system** automatically adjusts rates based on market conditions and borrower risk profiles.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üîÑ Dynamic Interest Rates**: Algorithm-based rates that adjust based on supply/demand and risk assessment
- **üìä Real-time Market Analysis**: Supply/demand tracking for optimal rate discovery
- **üéØ Risk-Based Pricing**: User reputation and collateral type influence interest rates
- **Multi-Asset Support**: Borrow and lend STX, SIP-10 tokens with various collateral types
- **NFT Collateral**: Use supported NFT collections as loan collateral with risk scoring
- **SIP-10 Token Support**: Lend and borrow various fungible tokens
- **Custom Loan Terms**: Borrowers can set maximum acceptable interest rates
- **Flexible Collateral**: Accept STX, SIP-10 tokens, or NFTs as collateral
- **Automated Liquidation**: Overdue loans are automatically liquidated to protect lenders
- **Advanced Reputation System**: Track user lending history, defaults, and build trust
- **Platform Fees**: Sustainable 2.5% fee structure for platform maintenance
- **Admin Controls**: Manage supported assets and collection parameters

## üîÑ Dynamic Interest Rate System

### How It Works

The platform automatically calculates optimal interest rates using multiple factors:

1. **Base Rate**: Platform-wide baseline interest rate (default: 5%)
2. **Utilization Rate**: Higher demand ‚Üí Higher rates
3. **Risk Assessment**: User history and collateral type influence
4. **Collateral Ratio**: Higher collateral ‚Üí Lower rates

### Rate Calculation Formula

```
Dynamic Rate = Base Rate + (Utilization Impact) + (Risk Impact) + (Collateral Impact)
```

### Risk Scoring System

- **Safe (1)**: High reputation, no defaults ‚Üí Lowest rates
- **Low (2)**: Good reputation, no recent defaults
- **Medium (3)**: New users or average reputation  
- **High (4)**: Users with 1 default or low reputation
- **Very High (5)**: Multiple defaults ‚Üí Highest rates

### Collateral Risk Assessment

- **STX Collateral**: Baseline risk
- **SIP-10 Tokens**: Risk varies by token stability
- **NFTs**: Collection-specific risk scores set by admins

### Rate Bounds

- **Minimum Rate**: 1% (adjustable by admin)
- **Maximum Rate**: 20% (adjustable by admin)
- **Collateral Bonus**: 200%+ collateral gets 0.5% rate discount

## üé® Supported Asset Types

### Lending Assets

### Collateral Assets

### Usage Examples

#### STX Loan with Dynamic Rates
```clarity
;; Create a loan requesting 1000 STX with 1500 STX collateral
;; Maximum acceptable rate: 8%, duration: 1 month
;; Actual rate will be calculated dynamically based on market conditions
(contract-call? .flexilend create-stx-loan u1000000000 u1500000000 u800 u5256)

;; Check what the current dynamic rate would be
(contract-call? .flexilend get-dynamic-rate 
  u1 ;; STX asset type
  none ;; No specific contract for STX
  tx-sender ;; Your address
  u1 ;; STX collateral type
  u1500000000 ;; Collateral amount
  u1000000000 ;; Loan amount
)

;; Fund the loan (as a lender)
(contract-call? .flexilend fund-stx-loan u1)
